## Hi. Iâ€™m Azhar.

I use this **space** to pen my thoughts on a range of topics that are at the intersection of computer science, data engineering, product design & development.

I've recently stepped down from my position as Data Engineer at [RateGain](https://rategain.com) to pursue graduate studies. I was part of the Data Science Lab at RateGain and worked on a diverse set of problems ranging from price optimizations techniques, sentiment analysis of reviews to building custom algorithms for city demand forecasting. Prior to RateGain, I was an undergraduate at Jamia Hamdard University in New Delhi, where I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

Most of my experience has been focused on the design & growth of analytic-driven systems and managing their scale. Usually, that means bouncing between research, feature design/development, growth analysis, and team coordination.

I love working on tools, infrastructure and scaling applications from the ground up. Heavily reliant on [Python](https://www.python.org) to get me out of trouble but sometimes also program in [Golang](https://golang.org) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org). 

I'm also an opensource contributor and regularly devote my time to projects like [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) & [Coala](https://coala.io/). 

When not writing code, I can be found playing football (soccer if you may), following the Champions League (Hala Madrid!), backpacking across the Indian subcontinent and outside of it once in a while. An avid quizzer who occasionally brags about random trivia that no one seems to care. Have a weak spot for good music and standup comedy.

And I use [Atom](https://atom.io).
